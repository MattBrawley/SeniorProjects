    "# Description:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This function will combine the gaussian distribution output from Alec's function, with the conular dispursion function.\n",
    "# This will be used for the combined assumption that the beam has a gaussian distribution, that is aimed perfectly to dispurse in a conular method.\n",
    "# The laser within the sc creates a gaussian beam, and a lens is used to refract the beam into a cone coming from the lens as an approximate point source.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions:\n",
    "# This function needs access to the transmission_funcs.ipynb file to call gaussian_transmission_func\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Errors & Checks:\n",
    "# This function also gives a check to if gaussian_transmission_func is running correctly, as in if it is outputting the correct total shell percentage.\n",
    "# This means that this function throws an error if it finds that the shell percentages dont sum close to 100%. \n",
    "# It will never be perfect, but it seems to usually be about 99.02% with current values, and it should always, if the function runs right with given values, return\n",
    "# something close to 100%. This efficeincy loss can be calculated, but I think we should include it as an uncertainty of our gaussian model.\n",
